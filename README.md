# scale-maker
scale-maker is a multi-propose internal built scale, perf, load generator which contains the binaries and tools needed to perform scale, perf or load tests. scale-maker was built on top of the open source framework and libraries such as go-fiber, client-go and apimachinery. In addition, it integrates with common load test tools like stress-ng and fio. scale-maker acts as an controller which the users can use to spin up measurable load containers via the built-in swagger UI or by calling the APIs directly.

The scale-maker container can be used to scale up the number of nodes and amount of loads within the K8S clusters. Here are some of the examples how scale-maker can be used to perform various debugging and troubleshooting.

1. Troubleshoot noisy neighbours - stress-ng pods and their CPU/memory resources can be configured to troubleshoot and debug the noisy neighbour issues. Hereâ€™s an example Mayank Kumar forwarded.
2. Provide perf/stress test binaries - fio binary was needed for GP3 root volume testing. The fio binary was added as a result. 
3. Verify zombie processes/pid limits - stress-ng has a number of parameters to spin up large number of zombie processes or normal load processes.
4. Debug CPU, memory and IO related issues - stress-ng can spin up separate or combine CPU/memory/IO work loads. Scale-maker can even randomly execute stress test from the 300+ stress-ng supported stress test cases.
